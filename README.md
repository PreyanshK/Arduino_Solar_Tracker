# Arduino_Solar_Tracker
This is the code for my automated Arduino Solar Tracker

It is written in C, and it has two sections.

1. First part is to detect light using the 4 photoresistors and rotating the servo motors accordingly

2. Second section is for the Bluetooth control mode, which allows user to control the movement of machine using Andriod device.
