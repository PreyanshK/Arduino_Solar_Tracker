This is the code for my automated Arduino Solar Tracker

It is written in C, and it has two sections.

1. First part is to detect light using the 4 photoresistors and rotating the servo motors accordingly

2. Second section is for the Bluetooth control mode, which allows the user to control the movement of the robot using an Android device.

Install this app on Google Play to connect to the Arduino Controllor: Arduino Servo Motor Control
